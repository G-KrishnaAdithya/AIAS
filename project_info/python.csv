In Flask, you define routes using a Python decorator (@app.route()) before a function definition. For example, @app.route('/hello') will define a route for the URL http://localhost:5000/hello. When a user visits this URL, the function that follows the decorator will be executed."
Flask,Medium,How do you render a template in Flask?,"You can render a template in Flask by using the render_template() function. First, you need to import the function by adding from flask import render_template to the top of your Python file. Then, within a function, you can call render_template() and pass the name of the template file as a string. For example, return render_template('index.html') will render the template file named index.html."
Flask,Hard,What is a Flask extension? Give an example of a Flask extension.,"A Flask extension is a third-party package that provides additional functionality for Flask. Extensions are typically installed using pip, and can be easily integrated into a Flask application.

It is responsible for processing user input, interacting with a database, and rendering a response. A view typically maps to a URL endpoint, and can be defined using a Python function or a class-based view. Views can also be decorated with Django's built-in decorators, such as @login_required or @csrf_exempt, to add additional functionality or security measures."
Django,Medium,What is the Django ORM?,"The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a database abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with a database using Python objects instead of SQL. It maps Python classes to database tables, and Python objects to database rows. The Django ORM provides a high-level API for performing database operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. It also includes advanced features such as lazy loading, transactions, and database migrations. The Django ORM supports multiple database backends, including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle."
Django,Medium,What is a Django template?,"In Django, a template is a text file that defines the structure and content of a web page. It can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Django template language (DTL) tags and filters. DTL tags allow you to control the flow of the template and access dynamic data, while filters allow you to modify and format data. Templates can be inherited from a base template, which allows you to reuse common elements across multiple pages. In Django, templates are rendered by views using the render() function, which takes a template file and a context dictionary as arguments."
Django,Hard,What is a Django middleware? Give an example of a Django middleware.,"A Django middleware is a component that sits between the web server and the view, and performs additional processing on the request and response. Middleware can be used for a variety of purposes, such as authentication, caching, compression, and logging. In Django, middleware is defined as a Python class that implements one or more of the middleware methods, such as process_request(), process_response(), or process_exception(). An example of a Django middleware is django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware, which provides Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for forms. This middleware adds a CSRF token to every form rendered by a view, and verifies the token on form submission"
